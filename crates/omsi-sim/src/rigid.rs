//! Rigid-body vehicle dynamics after Omsi.exe's own (0x7e2574; OMSI uses ODE only for the
//! objects a crash knocks over): a six-degree-of-freedom body with mass,
//! `[momentofintertia]` and `[schwerpunkt]`, wheels on spring/damper suspensions
//! (`achse_feder`, `achse_daempfer`, `achse_maxforce`, measured where the tyres stand
//! between `achse_minwidth` and `achse_maxwidth`, pushing from `achse_maxwidth`), every axle
//! steered towards the turning centre on `[rot_pnt_long]` with `[inv_min_turnradius]` as the
//! full lock, OMSI's grip across the tyres (the bus follows its wheels until the bend asks
//! more than the road's grip, then slides at mu x load), drive torque and brake forces from
//! the scripts, pitch and roll damped as OMSI damps them, gravity, ground contact per wheel
//! and impulse responses against obstacles. `examples/handling.rs` measures what a `.bus`
//! file makes of a bus.
//!
//! Ride height. A `.bus` file has no height for its axles: OMSI hangs each wheel so that
//! its spring is *unloaded* when the tyre stands on the model's ground plane (z = 0), and
//! the body then sinks by what the load compresses the springs - mass share over
//! `achse_feder` times the scripts' `Axle_Springfactor`. That sag is the `ai_deltaheight`
//! the same files give for their AI copies (-0.10 m for the SD202 and the NL202, whose
//! springs take 22-28 kN at 240-280 kN/m; -0.15 m for the F90 lorry, 55 kN at 370 kN/m),
//! and it is what `Axle_Suspension` reports: the model lifts the wheel into its arch by the
//! compression. Every vehicle therefore sits at its own height, set by its own data - the
//! NL202's level control even pumps its bellows until the compression reads 0.105 m.
