//! The enhanced renderer's light: a physically based atmosphere - Rayleigh and aerosol
//! scattering over a spherical Earth with ozone absorption, single scattering marched
//! along every view ray and the higher orders from a multiple-scattering table (Hillaire,
//! "A Scalable and Production Ready Sky and Atmosphere Rendering Technique", 2020) -
//! evaluated on the CPU whenever the sun, the moon or the weather has moved on.
//!
//! It yields the sun's colour and strength at the ground, the sky's radiance as a small
//! table the sky dome and the reflection probe read, the light the sky and the ground
//! throw on a surface of any orientation (spherical harmonics), and the exposure that
//! suits the whole of it - by night from the moon, whose light goes through the same
//! atmosphere, and the glow a city's lamps throw on its haze and its clouds.
//!
//! The air is not the same every day: how much aerosol there is and of which kind (fine
//! dry particles that scatter blue more than red, or a humid summer haze that scatters
//! all colours alike and whitens the sky) is part of the input, so a crisp winter
//! morning, a milky July afternoon and a clear evening after rain each look their own.
//!
//! The picture is balanced as a camera balances it: for daylight, and then a part of the
//! way towards the light of the moment (the golden hour stays golden, the blue hour blue,
//! but neither as strongly as an unbalanced sensor records them).
//!
//! Units: 1 = 10 000 lux of irradiance (the noon sun is about 10, a street under its lamps
//! about 0.002) and 1 per steradian of radiance.
