//! LAN play: several players on one map see and hear each other's buses and talk.
//!
//! One machine hosts (`LanSession::host`), the others join it (`LanSession::join`, or
//! `LanSession::discover` to find a host on the local network by broadcast). Everybody
//! sends the state of their own vehicle up to twenty times a second over UDP (five times a
//! second while nothing changes; a player without a vehicle sends an empty state once a
//! second, so that the others know it is still there); the host relays every state to
//! every other player (a star), so a client only ever talks to the host - and listens to
//! nobody else. The host also owns the world: a joining player takes the host's date, time
//! of day, weather and season (`Welcome::world`), and the host's clock keeps everybody's in
//! step (`CLOCK`).
//!
//! A host is found by its **session code** (`SessionCode`): the host's LAN address, its
//! port and a random session id with a checksum, written in a base-32 alphabet without
//! look-alike characters (`OMSI-7Q4K-2M9X-HD3P-R8TZ-KC5W-NB6E`). A joining player may give
//! the code, an `ip`, `ip:port`, a bare port (a host on this machine) or nothing (search
//! the network): `parse_join`.
//!
//! The vehicle state is a bit-packed binary datagram (`wire`: position, pitch and bank,
//! speed, steering, lights, indicators, engine speed and pedals, doors, wheel travel, the
//! rear sections of an articulated bus, and the vehicle's own lamp, switch and sound
//! variables). Everything else is plain text, one message per datagram, with `|` between
//! the fields. Every message that opens a conversation carries the protocol version
//! (`PROTOCOL`), and a host turns away a client of another version (with a message saying
//! so) or with the code of another session:
//!
//! ```text
//! HELLO|<proto>|<session or ->|<name>|<bus>|<map>|<date>|<time>|<weather>|<season>|<nonce>

//!                                                host: its own people on foot

//! GRANT|<person>,… / DENY|<person>,…             host → client: handed over, or not
//! ```
//!
//! `<footprints>` are the vehicles standing near the place a client's bus was put at
//! (`x,y,z,heading,length,width` separated by `;`), so that the client can move it in
//! front of or behind them instead of into them. `<table>` is the hash of the vehicle's
//! sync table (which lamp, switch and sound variables the state lists, in which order):
//! two games with different versions of a vehicle leave those lists alone.
//!
//! The host checks everything it takes in: a message must come from the address the
//! player joined from and carry that player's id, text is cut to size and cleaned of
//! separators and control characters, numbers must be finite and in range, vehicle paths
//! must stay inside a content folder, and every player may send only so much per second.
//!
//! Nothing here knows about rendering: the game turns the remote states into vehicles it
//! draws and hears like AI traffic, and draws the host's world (`omsi-app::lan_world`).
//! The host simulates the traffic, the timetable buses, the people and the traffic lights
//! for everybody; a client simulates its own bus and the passengers the host hands over to
//! it. Money and the timetable of the player's own duty stay local to each player.
//!
//! A host is joined by its code, or by any of its addresses (`addrs`): the code carries up
//! to three of them (a VPN's first - Hamachi, Radmin VPN, ZeroTier, Tailscale - then the
//! LAN's), and a joining game says hello to all of them at once, takes the first that
//! answers, and gives up with a message saying why that may be after `JOIN_TIMEOUT`.
