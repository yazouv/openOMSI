> [!WARNING]
> **Early release. Expect bugs.** openOMSI is in an early stage of development: things may be
> missing, broken or change between versions. Please report problems in
> [Issues](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/issues) or on our
> [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VG2EKVafYG).

**openOMSI** is a from-scratch recreation of the bus simulator **OMSI 2**, written in Rust:
64-bit, multithreaded, with a modern renderer (Metal / Vulkan / DirectX 12 through wgpu),
and fully compatible with the existing maps, buses, scenery and mods.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **openOMSI needs an original copy of OMSI 2.** It contains no game content of its own: it
> plays on the maps, vehicles and other files of an installed OMSI 2 and **will not start without one**.


## Download

Every commit to `main` is built by GitHub Actions and published on the
[**Releases**](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/releases) page:

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| Windows x64 / ARM64 | `openOMSI-<version>-windows-x64.zip` / `-windows-arm64.zip` - run `openomsi.exe` |
| macOS (Apple silicon / Intel) | `openOMSI-<version>-macos-arm64.zip` / `-macos-x64.zip` - open `openOMSI.app` |
| Linux x64 / ARM64 | `openOMSI-<version>-linux-x64.zip` / `-linux-arm64.zip` - run `openomsi` |
| Android (arm64, 8.0+) | `openOMSI-<version>-android-arm64.apk` - see [docs/ANDROID.md](docs/ANDROID.md) |
| Dedicated server | `openOMSI-<version>-server-linux-x64.zip` (also `-linux-arm64`, `-windows-x64`, `-windows-arm64`) - see [docs/SERVER.md](docs/SERVER.md) |

Start the game, point the launcher to your OMSI 2 folder once, pick a map, a bus and a duty,
and drive. Mods go into the folder next to the game (or through the launcher's **Mods**
page); the original installation is never written to.

From 0.1.7 on the launcher updates itself: when a newer release is out it asks at the start
and, with your yes, downloads it, replaces the program and starts again (on Android through
the system's installer). Settings → General → Updates switches the check off or installs without
asking.

## Installation

**You need an installed OMSI 2** (Steam or retail, any version) with its stock content -
the maps Grundorf and Berlin-Spandau and the stock buses (MAN SD200/SD202, NL). openOMSI
brings no game content of its own; it plays the original's maps, buses and mods.

1. **Download** the file for your system from
   [Releases](https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI/releases) (table above) and unpack it
   into a folder of its own that you can write to - your Documents, a games folder, or the
   OMSI 2 folder itself. Not `Program Files`: the launcher could not update itself there.
2. **Start it.**
   * **Windows:** `openomsi.exe`. Windows SmartScreen may warn about an unknown app: *More
     info* → *Run anyway*.
   * **macOS:** open `openOMSI.app`. The first time, macOS may refuse an app from the
     internet: right-click → *Open* → *Open*, or run
     `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/openOMSI.app` once.
   * **Linux:** `./openomsi` (run `chmod +x openomsi` if it does not start). It needs a
     Vulkan or OpenGL driver (Mesa: `mesa-vulkan-drivers`, or your GPU vendor's driver).
   * **Android:** see [docs/ANDROID.md](docs/ANDROID.md) - the OMSI 2 folder is copied onto the
     phone first.
3. **Point it at OMSI 2.** The launcher usually finds the installation by itself (Steam
   libraries, the usual folders). If not, open **Setup** and choose the OMSI 2 folder - the
   one with `Omsi.exe`, `maps` and `Vehicles` in it (the folder, or `Omsi.exe` itself) - and
   press **Save**. The Steam version is under
   `…\Steam\steamapps\common\OMSI 2`.
4. **Drive:** pick a bus, a map and a duty on the **Drive** page and press **Start the duty**.

**Mods** are installed on the **Mods** page (a folder or a `.zip`, or dropped on the window) or
by putting them into the `Mods` folder next to the game; the OMSI 2 folder is never written
to.

### When something goes wrong

* **"The original OMSI 2 was not found"** - choose the folder under Setup (step 3); the
  message says what the chosen folder lacks.
* **The game closes after a few seconds, or "the graphics device was lost"** - update the
  graphics driver (NVIDIA, AMD or Intel's own, not the one Windows installs). On Windows you
  can also switch to DirectX 12: Settings → Graphics → Graphics API (the launcher offers it after such a
  crash).
* **An older graphics card** (no Vulkan): openOMSI falls back to DirectX 12 and then OpenGL by
  itself; Settings → Graphics → Graphics API chooses one.
* **Stuck at a bridge or an invisible wall** on a mod map: Esc → Options → *Collisions with
  objects* switches collisions with the map's objects off (Settings has it too).
* **Multiplayer: you do not meet the others** - both players need the host's map (a map in
  the OMSI 2 folder is not passed on; one from the Mods page is). The joining game switches
  to the host's map by itself and says in the HUD when it is not installed.
* **Keys do not do what you set:** Controls - the page shows which driving keys are in use;
  a key you change there takes effect at once.
* **Anything else:** when the game ends on an error, the launcher shows it with *Copy report*
  and *Report on GitHub*. The logs are in `~/.openomsi` (Windows: `C:\Users\<you>\.openomsi`),
  `game.log` for the last game.

## Goals

1. **1:1 behaviour.** Every content format of the original - maps, splines, scenery objects,
   vehicles, scripts, timetables, HOF files, fonts, weather, tickets, situations, plugins -
   loads and behaves exactly as in OMSI 2.2.032. Existing maps and mods work unchanged.
2. **No original code or assets.** Nothing from the original is copied; the formats are
   described in [docs/FORMATS.md](docs/FORMATS.md).
3. **A better engine.** 64-bit address space, streaming and texture loading on worker threads,
   no 2 GB limit, no single-thread stalls, LAN multiplayer and a dedicated server.

## Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openOMSI-Project/openOMSI.git && cd openOMSI
scripts/build-macos.sh        # macOS   → dist/macos/openOMSI.app
scripts\build-windows.cmd     # Windows → dist\windows\openomsi.exe
scripts/build-linux.sh        # Linux   → dist/linux/openomsi
scripts/build-android.sh      # Android → dist/android/openOMSI-<version>.apk
scripts/build-server.sh       # server  → dist/server
```

Needs the latest [Rust stable](https://rustup.rs) and the platform's C toolchain; details in
[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md).
